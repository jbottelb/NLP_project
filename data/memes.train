303720 8294.0 0 1591575369 <COMMENT> Flat Earthers don't really deny how big the Earth is. So it's actually very easy to use trig to prove the distance to the sun is much farther than flat Earthers say it is. Using their own estimates for distance the sun would be 4x farther away at sunrise/sunset than noon. Also the light would be 16x dimmer because light fades at a square root. Something they can test themselves with a flashlight. However the sun looks larger at sunrise/sunset. So simple observation contradicts their estimates so much it's obvious even without measurements. The only way to fix this is to have the sun way further out and way bigger. That way it looks nearly the same distance away at the horizon or directly above. However if the earth was flat you then all of the Earth is ether in daytime or night time. Something that is easy to prove is not the case. <POST> A short story<SPLIT>4

1) they have a Facebook dating group called Flat Earth Match that has around 2.5K members now.

2) They thought a simulation at a space museum was touch screen and called it broken while completely ignoring the big green "Start" button right next to one of the seats.

3)One of them tried using planks with 7 foot high holes at a mile apart with one guy using a camera and the other had a flashlight at different planks. The guy with the flashlight had to raise it a few feet for them to see it. (proving a curve) They decide to try redoing the experiment later with proof of the redo in the documentary. <POST> A short story<SPLIT>2

303720 11618.0 0 0 <COMMENT> I had a conversation many years ago with a flat earther. 

He was intelligent. Seemed well educated. It was so strange. After a few hours he just came out with the truth. It’s a thought exercise, playing devils advocate no matter what and how insane it gets and that he was well traveled enough/had a brain to know the earth wasn’t flat

He explained it was a mental game. A troll. It would frustrate those who thought reasonably. He didn’t actually like flat earthers who fell for it. He said something along the lines of ‘those people are morons, the type of idiot that you could make fall for anything if you sound intelligent enough’. <POST> A short story<SPLIT>2

But above all, it was a story of redemption. And it was one I, and the rest of this band of men, are proud to have witnessed. So to the hero of this epic saga: carry on. Don’t lose sight of the eternal wisdom you have gained. Enlighten those who have lost their way, for you were once one of them too. And with those final words, I must depart. Farewell.

Later on that year his father died and shortly after he found out his wife was having an affair with the vice principal.  He ended up shooting himself and I was heartbroken.  I still remember the last time I saw him and he asked how my calc was - I was still flunking it but since he had made such an effort I lied and said my grades had turned around. <POST> She did her best ok?<SPLIT>6852

About 30 min before the class started we asked another teacher to unlock the classroom and we set up in there, 5 minutes before class started he unlocked the door and we all yelled happy birthday!

He was really happy and instead of doing the actual things he had planned we all ate our cake and played different party games together, it was our last year at that school so we wanted to make it a bit special for him.

Still my best memory from that school. <POST> She did her best ok?<SPLIT>68

“Mr. W, why do we always do nachos and cheese for parties?” 

Me: Because I can just keep adding water and stretching it to feed as many of you as I can.

Or when a parent complained one time about me asking for a dollar to bring in and help cover supplies but she drove up in a Mercedes. 

Her: my taxes pay your salary, so I’ve already given you a dollar. 

Me: ma’am, due to local taxes and millages, your overall contribution is really about $15 for every $100,000 your home is worth. So taking the $45 you might give, divided amongst 800 teachers in the district, I’m not really seeing your single impact on my check.

Pick a teacher in your state/town (or anywhere if you like), buy supplies off their Amazon wish list, ship directly to their classroom.  It rocks.  What would rock more is if states and communities funded their schools a lot better, but this'll have to do in the meantime. <POST> She did her best ok?<SPLIT>2

271680 14877.0 0 0 <COMMENT> My 2nd grade teacher made a rather large activity packet for us to do over the summer. It was like getting three months of homework in one lump sum. Any student who completed the whole thing by the end of the summer break was rewarded with a lunch party at Friendly’s. I didn’t fully appreciate it back then, but holy crap was that an amazing thing for an elementary school teacher to do! She wasn’t even our assigned teacher anymore and the work wasn’t for any sort of credit for us OR paycheck for her. She was only trying to keep our minds engaged while we were away from the classroom. If I remember correctly, only about 7 (+/-) of us completed the packet, but that STILL must have been a hefty Friendly’s bill. All for the love of teaching.

271680 14877.0 0 0 <COMMENT> When I was in senior highschool our "class adviser" (I don't know what they're called in other countries, but she's the one handling our whole class affairs) always bring a big ass pot with hot soups/"champorado"(hot chocolate with sticky rice) every morning for us to have a breakfast before class because she noticed that most of us are so sleepy and have low energy every morning. She did it for most of our school year. Knowing how big the pot is she probably wakes up around 4am-5am to prepare it (our classes starts at 7:30) and spend her own money every day to buy the ingredients for it. She refuses to take our contributions for it as well. Best teacher I ever had, literally like having a second mom. <POST> She did her best ok?<SPLIT>2

234163 4482.0 0 0 <COMMENT> For those wondering who won, there were 2 battles. The Josh Swain battle, and the all Joshes batlle (this is the one on the image). There were 2 Josh Swains who showed up and the winner was determined through rock paper scissors. Josh Swain came out on top.
The all joshes battle was the pool noodle fight depicted in the image on this post, and a boy who most called "Little Josh" was the winner. 

tl;dr: Josh won. <POST> They DID It ! They actually did it ! Battle of Josh<SPLIT>25697

234163 4442.0 0 0 <COMMENT> So from my understanding, Josh came in hot, but then Josh came from behind and hit Josh so hard that Josh fell over. Josh came to his aid while Josh came behind and chocked Josh out. This led to Josh feeling confident, but wouldn’t you know it, Josh then came in out of nowhere and dropkicked Josh. While walking away Josh came in with a rubber battle axe and swung at Josh. Josh was able to duck just in the Knick of time and landed a mean uppercut hitting Josh directly under the chin. Josh was seriously impressive throughout the battle.

222696 2362.0 0 0 <COMMENT> Explanation

You have candy. I ask to borrow that candy. I sell that candy to my friend. I hope the price will go down so I can buy back that candy, give you your candy back, and pocket the difference.

But the price didnt go down and my friend doesn't want to sell me the candy back. Well now I gotta go to the store to buy candy to give to you. But all the stores are sold out because everyone loves candy.

You are very angry at me and demand I get you the candy back, no matter what the cost. So I pay lots of money for super expensive candy that nobody else buys.

Now I'm very sad cause I have no candy and I have no money :(

Im Melvin Capital, the candy is GameStop, and everyone buying candy is Reddit.

12,000 years / 4 years per leap year = 3000 leap years. 3000 extra leap days / 365 days per year = 8.219 extra years to add to the 2012 date. <POST> We are doomed<SPLIT>163

IMHO, he stole every scene from Jackson, Fox, and Waltz that he was on. Props to Tarantino for directing too but my god I loved every scene DiCaprio was in.

It’s a show that makes fun of society sometimes exaggerating things in a funny and comical way and guess what, sometimes real life and real stories are funny and comical, that’s when the two things coincide.
662 episodes and a movie, you bet it has some connection with reality, cause it’s based on it!

204498 17545.0 0 0 <COMMENT> This is a friendly reminder that r/wallstreetbets didn't manipulate, hack and didn't do anything shady. They simply researched publicly available info and bought the stock. 

It was the short selling hedge funds that shorted the stock over 140% of available shares that are the cause of what we see today.

They’ll just get the debt forgiven? Government will use taxpayer money as bailout? Cronies in high places will just let a few small hedges die and call the rest of it off and nobody will hold them accountable?

What's not above board is Melvin Capital selling short over literally every single outstanding share in GameStop, taking advantage of a company struggling due to Covid, and then brokers like Robinhood preventing any form of buying action on their platform while still allowing selling action, guaranteeing the price goes down in an attempt to let the hedgefunds that fucked up unfuck themselves at the expense of the people who noticed and acted on their fuck up. <POST> What a shame<SPLIT>2

if you use the gi bill for 4 years of a grad school (MBA + JD for example) you can get close to $400,000 in payouts (Tuition 60k a year + housing allowance + stipends). i know a guy who did that - 28 years old, got to live in germany a few years, earned a masters in business, law degree and no debt.

the people who go infantry arent doing for the gi bill, i promise you that. if literally ALL they qualified for was infantry and were forced into it, college is off the table 100% and they probably cheated through high school if they even graduated. <POST> Wait I didn't mean it like that<SPLIT>136

He got sick the day the surgery was supposed to happen, so it was postponed indefinitely. Then he went to another doctor who prescribing him a placebo.

199240 21855.0 0 1594071516 <COMMENT> It's a common misconception that Placebos heal you, they generally don't. People just usually feel better when they take something, that doesn't mean placebo can e.g. reduce tumor size or increase your survival chance when having an infection.

Edit: An example on Wikipedia is that people with insomnia reported to have slept better on placebo, but measurements for sleep quality stayed the same. The only thing where placebos really help is pain, because there how you perceive it is all that matters. <POST> Placebo in a nutshell<SPLIT>16

199240 15850.0 0 0 <COMMENT> This comments section is so chock full of misinformation around the placebo effect it astounds me. The placebo effect is not a magic 'mind-over-matter' cure-all that can regenerate limbs. It is the name given to the collective un-measured variables in a study (regression to the mean, spontaneous remission etc.) so that we can measure the effect of the variable being studied.

199240 21490.0 0 0 <COMMENT> Kind of interesting how this stuff works; some doctors use neurological integration to basically show the brain where a ‘bug’ is in the body and direct the immune system to that area. Tapping the top of the head activates both hemispheres of the brain, while blood on the surface of the skin makes the brain check over the body. This paired with some muscle testing (to find where the ‘bug’ is located) and activation of the corresponding parts of the body accesses the virus/bacteria greatly speeding up the recovery process. <POST> Placebo in a nutshell<SPLIT>1

(25 for the new guy and 100 for the experienced) and these guys job is to check up on each of their 50 everyday and some actual grow attached. "Nice job Matt I knew you'd pass that test!" "Damnit girl they are no good to you and if you get your heart broken boi better square up! Aye Jeffery you better watch your boi I'ma whoop him!" "ah shit man 65th birthday already I'm wishing you more years I ain't ready to see you go yet." "Oh no  don't think like that, there is so much more to you then you could imagine, life ain't so bad and it gets better if only you could see what I see you'd find out you're special in your own way and deserve not only life but respect from both your colleagues and yourself, hang in there!" <POST> You think you are sad<SPLIT>2

196539 9991.0 0 0 <COMMENT> Here is a tip, Pantene goes well with any kind of body wash. Remember that the shampoos that seem safe to the eyes on the bottle are the strongest so I would only recommend using them once you have a bit more experience and have made a few successful potions. When you add a soap bar the safe for eyes shampoo is weakened but is still stronger than a regular bottle of shampoo.

If started out innocent enough. Your usual water base, then some dirt and flour, maybe a few actual flowers as well.

Then came the brainwave. The element that would truly complete the potion.

My sister asked for the potion and peed into it (we were very young at this point, mind you).

We were so proud that we took it to school the next day.

It. Fucking. Reeked.

It was so gross, that people were coming over to inspect what the commotion was. My mother, who worked at the school as a teacher, caught on to this pretty fast and had us throw it away (party pooper mum).

Later that day, after the piss potion had been roasting in the outdoor bin under direct sunlight, the bin itself was almost impossible to see through the hundreds, if not thousands of flies that were swarming to that delicious sewerage bouquet.

Anyways one day we filled a jar  (with no lid) full of stuff and added milk for some reason, we left for a week long trip and came back to a house that REEKED of death and perfume.  Turns out the jar had exploded somehow (I’m sure it was some sort of chemical reaction). They had to get a new bed and we got smacked with a wet belt, no more experiments after that :( <POST> It was fun doe<SPLIT>2

Whenever I'm sitting around with my neutral face, people always wonder if something's wrong. Heck, when I was a teenager working at a grocery store getting carts in the parking lot, I had a lady randomly give me $5 because she thought I "looked sad." I was feeling perfectly fine that day!

188965 13718.0 0 0 <COMMENT> The reason a college degree is a standard for even jobs like this is simple. A 4-year college degree is like a large project that takes persistence, dedication, and considerable effort to complete. 

Just by completing one, you have shown that you have the horsepower to take on serious tasks and see them through to completion. 

This isn’t the case for everyone, but a lot of people who I know proudly say “I’m never going to college, fuck that!” are some of the least reliable people, generally speaking. <POST> These are confusing times<SPLIT>20

A degree shows that you can do the "basic" stuff in your industry. Not saying that a Master's Degree in Engineering is basic, but relative to a specific sector and/or specialization, it is. You still have **a lot** to learn. Complete university shows that you have the strength and willpower to go through a challenging and sometimes tedious work. You can also indicate that having experience from a similar position, and many companies acknowledge that. My good friend has no degree and has worked his way up, and a lot of my colleagues are without degrees. It's just two ways to get to the same spot. 

But with that said, don't expect getting hired for a position without experience or a degree, even though the job doesn't use everything taught in school :)

I’d like to point out the application process asked me all kinds of illegal questions such as my sexuality my gender identity and my racial background.

188140 8775.0 0 0 <COMMENT> Former pizza dude here. The pizza delivery time usually has less to do with a driver's skill/effort than the actual demand on drivers at the restaurant. So a late pizza usually means that a driver didn't happen to be available because they were all on other deliveries. More a capacity thing than a smart/fast driver thing. <POST> That's a 5 stars from me<SPLIT>2

188140 10399.0 0 0 <COMMENT> Idk man, I had a pretty good uber ride to the airport a few months back with a super friendly dude who didn't really cross the line. It was just light convo where he asked about my work, told me about his, why he moved to the city, and his future plans. He also tought me something about his favorite sport, Cricket, which I know nothing about.

I think it's more about the type of convo than it is the quantity of convo. Too much is a thing, but awkward silence is weird too. Just keep the convo light and don't give me your theories about the world and what pisses you off about the government. I don't care.

Oh, guys that deliver pizza 10 minutes early? Amazing. When they bring hand sanitizer and say "I hope that you and your loved ones are safe and enjoy this evening" I wish I could give you a bonus star. <POST> That's a 5 stars from me<SPLIT>1
188140 10555.0 0 0 <COMMENT> I prefer a uber driver that engages in interesting and fun conversations, that's way better than a silent one. 

I also think the pizza should arrive the time you've agreed because who knows if you are home at the time it comes or whatever. Unless of course you've said that you want it asap! I assume that's the case here. <POST> That's a 5 stars from me<SPLIT>1
188140 10612.0 0 0 <COMMENT> The only time I took an Uber, the guy talked quite a bit. But that’s what I wanted. My phone was almost dead, so I would just be sitting for a half hour ride. It was also pitch black outside, so there wasn’t much to see either. 

Definitely a 5 star worthy ride. He was very polite and his car was spacious and comfortable.

185751 10270.0 0 0 <COMMENT> In grad school the group of students in my department, Business Analytics, would often share homework assignments. We had a class we took in the computer science department looking at data mining algorithms using Python. I would do the basic assignment and give that to my classmates and then I would add extra stuff to mine so even if someone turned in the exact thing that I sent out I wouldn't get caught for it. 

I was not smart enough to do this in freshman undergrad and once like 12 people submitted my matlab code for a class. The TA for the class was livid. "We had 12 people submit the exact same code, one of which must have typed it from a printout and made errors to the point his code wouldn't run, but Jesus just magically popped out the graphs for him." They gave us all zeros, but did say it was beautifully written code. <POST> Well its pretty similar...<SPLIT>6

184051 7798.0 0 0 <COMMENT> George Floyd was an African American man. Police were called over a supposed counterfeit 20$ bill. After he was in handcuffs and on the floor a white officer held his knee on George Floyd’s neck. He did this for nine minutes as George Floyd was telling the office that he couldn’t breath. George Floyd went unconscious and even after that the officer still held his knee there. George Floyd later died. This officer had a smirk on his face the entire time. This officer by the name of Derek Chauvin had 18 previous complaints against him. This officer should have never been kept on the force. There were other officers watching and they did nothing even with bystanders screaming. <POST> can someone explain it<SPLIT>1471

184051 9979.0 0 1591037416 <COMMENT> The civil war never stopped in the US. The Union won the war but it didn’t change the beliefs or hearts and minds of the Confederate south if anything it just made their hate, bigotry, and racism stronger. This has been simmering under the surface the whole time. And it’s spread throughout the US. Look at how people of color have been treated in this country all along. The difference is we now have leaders who say it’s okay to be outwardly hateful. People have had enough. This is a war against racism.

Edit: I didn’t mean to make it seem as if the whole south is a teaming bed of racists. Racism is everywhere. And it was in the northern states during the civil war as well it just wasn’t as blatant.

There were literally like 40 people standing within elbow reach next to each other at the checkin, and apparently the entire park was flooded with people. When asked they said: well it's a beautiful day, I cant just spend it indoors.

183828 9514.0 0 0 <COMMENT> A few years ago, some friends of my parents came over once and their 3 kids were allowed to play in my room with some toys i left for them. I told my parents they weren’t allowed to touch my xbox, they said “fine, we’ll tell them not to.”

when I returned from a weekend at my dad’s, i found my sticky, covered in chips controller on my bed. After cleaning it, it still had 2 buttons on my controller that stay pressed in after you press them.

Long story short, I learned that you can’t fucking trust kids or your parents to keep an eye on them

I have never let another child enter my room since then.

it always broke my heart because they've been one of my favorite animals since I was little. then in my mid twenties my cat brought me at least 4 of them over time.

183399 6940.0 0 0 <COMMENT> Currently, according to a recent census survey done in Japan, the average height for Japanese women is 5’4, and for men it’s 5’7.

As a 5’4 woman I fit right in but I feel bad for men that are taller than 5’10 (Japanese men don’t tend to be taller than this) that go to Japan and have issues like this. It’s kinda funny that people make such a big deal about height and “the taller the better” seems to be the thing, but it goes to show that there’s pros and cons to everything. <POST> *bumps head* maybe I’m Godzilla?<SPLIT>176
