If there was a larger animal, it would be an ocean animal like the blue whale, and its dead body would fall to the ocean floor where we'd never find it, hence no evidence.

42197 14517.0 0 0 <COMMENT> Fun fact: the largest animal on Earth at any given point in time is probably an aquatic air-breathing animal.

There are two factors that limit maximum size:

1. Ability to move around with gravity. Being in water helps for obvious reasons.

2. Ability to supply enough oxygen to all cells to survive. It turns out, breathing air and having lungs is incredibly more effective than having gills.

Hence, whales. <POST> Heavily inspired by Hannah Hillam<SPLIT>1

Athletic is a plus, but not mandatory.
